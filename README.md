# FOOTBALL_MGMNT
Become a successful football manager!

This project's aim is to create a realistic football management simulation. It is going to be mostly text-based and look similar to Championship Manager 97/98. It should feature top European Leagues, including: Spain, Italy, Germany, England, France, Holland, and possibly some other leagues. The graphics library used in this game is SDL2.

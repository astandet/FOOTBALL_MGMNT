# FOOTBALL_MGMNT
Become a successful football manager!

This project's aim is to create a realistic football management simulation. It is going to be mostly text-based and look similar to Championship Manager 97/98. It should feature top European Leagues, including: Spain, Italy, Germany, England, France, Holland, and possibly some other leagues. The graphics library used in this game is SDL2. 

The game engine will take into consideration factors such as: current quality of players, based on their attributes (hidden and visible), tiredness, morale etc, perceived quality of the teams, past history of matches between the teams, special factors and more. It is essential that the scores remain realistic at all times, i.e. teams like San Marino playing against top teams like Spain must lose by appropriate margin, typically 4+ goal difference.

Players
-------

Players should be stored in a database, like: PostgreSQL and ideally there should be a community-based system, whereby members of public could update the database with real players data. Alternatively, player names and statistics can be auto-generated.
